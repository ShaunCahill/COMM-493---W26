    "### Real-world SMB Example: Categorizing House Price Tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you run a small real estate agency. Instead of just \"above or below median,\" you want to categorize houses into price tiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class 0 (Budget)**: Lower third of the market - starter homes, first-time buyers\n",
    "- **Class 1 (Mid-Range)**: Middle third - typical family homes, most common segment\n",
    "- **Class 2 (Premium)**: Upper third - luxury features, high-end buyers\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you:\n",
    "- **Target marketing**: Different advertising strategies for each price tier\n",
    "- **Match clients**: Connect buyers with appropriate properties faster\n",
    "- **Staff allocation**: Assign agents based on their expertise with different market segments\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Configured and trained a Linear Learner model for multi-class classification\n",

    "\n",
    "- Multi-class classification predicts **one of three or more categories**\n",
    "- The model outputs probabilities for each class, not just the predicted class\n",
    "- The confusion matrix shows which classes get confused with each other\n",
    "- Per-class metrics help identify which categories are easier or harder to predict\n",
    "- **Critical**: You must set `num_classes` to match your data\n",

    "| Aspect | Regression | Binary Classification | Multi-class Classification (This Notebook) |\n",
    "|--------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Business Question** | \"How much?\" or \"How many?\" | \"Yes or no?\" | \"Which category?\" |\n",
    "| **Prediction Output** | A single number | 0 or 1 (with probability) | One of 3+ classes (with probabilities) |\n",

    "### When to Use Multi-class Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Use multi-class classification when:\n",
    "- You need to categorize items into 3 or more groups\n",
    "- The categories are mutually exclusive (each item belongs to exactly one category)\n",
    "- You want to see probabilities for each possible category\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: product categorization, risk tier assignment (low/medium/high), sentiment analysis (negative/neutral/positive), customer segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Confusion Matrix for Multi-class\n",
    "\n",
    "The NxN confusion matrix shows:\n",
    "- **Diagonal cells**: Correct predictions (each row's actual class matches the column's predicted class)\n",
    "- **Off-diagonal cells**: Misclassifications (shows which classes get confused with which)\n",
    "- **Row sums**: Total actual samples for each class\n",
    "- **Column sums**: Total predictions for each class\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for patterns in misclassifications:\n",
    "- Are adjacent classes confused? (e.g., Mid-Range confused with Budget or Premium)\n",
    "- Is one class consistently mispredicted?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression notebook**: When you need an exact numeric prediction (e.g., \"What price will this sell for?\")\n",
    "- **Binary Classification notebook**: When your question is yes/no (e.g., \"Will this customer churn?\")\n",
